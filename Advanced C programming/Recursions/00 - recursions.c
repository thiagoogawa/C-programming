// recursion -> new approach to solve problems

// problem to sub-problems: can we solve the original problem 
// by dividing and solving some smaller "sub problems"?

// real-life examples of recursions:
// 1 - Russian dolls
// 2 - Dream inside dream
// 3 - Counting folders
// 4 - Write recursion in google
