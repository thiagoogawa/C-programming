# 01 – Simple House Generator

A simple C program that uses dynamic memory allocation (malloc and free) to generate random house data (area, number of bedrooms, and years since construction) for a user-defined number of houses. This project was built as part of Gustavo Azevedo Naldoni’s Advanced C course.
```

You will be prompted to enter the number of houses to generate. The program will then display each house’s attributes:

Enter the number of houses to generate: 3

====== HOUSE 1 ======

Area (m²) = 247
Number of bedrooms = 5
Years since construction = 18

====== HOUSE 2 ======

Area (m²) = 162
Number of bedrooms = 2
Years since construction = 7

====== HOUSE 3 ======

Area (m²) = 291
Number of bedrooms = 9
Years since construction = 24
```
